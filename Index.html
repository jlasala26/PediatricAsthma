<p>
    According to the National Institute of Health, Pediatric asthma rates among Bronx children are above national pediatric asthma rates. 15.5% of 4–5-year-old Bronx children have asthma compared to 9.2% of New York City students overall and 8.9% of overall children in the US between the ages of 2 to 17 years of age.

<p> According to the NIH, in the period between 2017-2019, 1,920 children were admitted to the hospital in the Bronx due to asthma. Medical records confirmed the demographic and clinical diagnosis. "Ambient particulate and ozone pollution" is currently associated with longer hospital stays for children with asthma and exacerbating pre exisiting conditions. </p>

    <p> The rate of Pediatric Asthma in Northern Manhattan is four times the national average. Lack of appropriate asthma care has led to significant health risks for children with asthma and has impacted the quality of life for their families. In May 2006, New York-Presbyterian hospital started the Washington-Heights Inwood Network (WIN) for Asthma – a  partnership with the local community which is designed to improve outcomes for children with poorly controlled asthma. The Lower East side districts also has one of the highest rates of childhood asthma in New York City.</p>

    <p> As of 2020 the Bedford Stuyvesant - Crown Heights area of Brooklyn recieved higher asthma emergency department visits of children between the ages of 5 to 17 years old compared to the NYC average. Higher ozone and fine particle levels are major contributers to this issue. The Bed-stuy/Crown heights area has one of the highest home maintenence problems such as cracks and leaks which are other common factors. </p>

<div> <img src="images/noun-queens-160966.png" alt="Queens map">

    <p> South Jamaica, Queens has a high instance of hospitalizations from asthma attacks and is close to John F. Kennedy International Airport. Lorna Davis, Director of Health Services at Safe Space, runs the Jamaica Childhood Asthma Initiative and believes there may be ties between the airport being near the community and the asthma rates. Approximately 35,000 Queens residents under 18 have asthma and it is more prevalent in southeast Queens. According to the Queens Borough Board's budget review, as a result of the Jamaica Childhood Asthma Initiative, asthma sufferers’ visits to the emergency room were reduced by 50 percent.</p>
